## 🚫 Things to Avoid / Don’t Let Happen

- Being vague: answers that don’t show what you did.
    
- Too many filler words or rambling.
    
- Speaking too fast because of nerves — makes you unclear.
    
- Bad body language: slouching, avoiding eye contact, fidgeting too much.
    
- Negative talk about past employers.
    
- Overpromising; saying things just to please rather than being honest.
    
- Not preparing: e.g. not knowing what the BPO does, or what your role would entail.


### 💡 *1. The STAR Interview Framework*

*Purpose:* Helps assess real behavior and decision-making.  
*Structure:*

- *S* – Situation: Ask the trainee to describe a specific work or life situation.
    
- *T* – Task: What goal or challenge did they face?
    
- *A* – Action: What did they do?
    
- *R* – Result: What was the outcome?
    

*Example Question:*  
“Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult customer. What was the situation, what did you do, and what was the result?”

---

### 🧠 *2. Behavioral vs. Situational Questions*

*Behavioral:* “Tell me about a time when…” (past behavior)  
*Situational:* “What would you do if…” (hypothetical scenario)

👉 Mix both to test *experience + reasoning*.  
For BPO jobs, these measure composure, empathy, and communication under pressure.

---

### 🔍 *3. Interview Flow Structure for HireXP*

*You can structure your AI or human interview like this:*

#### *Stage 1: Warm-Up / Rapport Building (2–3 mins)*

- “Hi [Name], how are you feeling today?”
    
- “Can you tell me a bit about yourself?”
    
- Purpose: Relax the trainee and test fluency & confidence.
    

#### *Stage 2: Core Interview (6–8 mins)*

- Mix of 10–15 questions covering:
    
    - Communication
        
    - Problem-solving
        
    - Empathy
        
    - Adaptability
        
    - Call-handling logic (mock situations)
        
    - Willingness to work night shifts, etc.
        

#### *Stage 3: Simulation or Role-Play (5–7 mins)*

- Example: “You’re a call center agent, and I’m a frustrated customer asking about my bill.”
    
- Evaluate: tone, empathy, problem-solving, and control.
    

#### *Stage 4: Wrap-Up (2 mins)*

- “Do you have any questions for us?”
    
- “Thank you! We’ll update you soon.”
