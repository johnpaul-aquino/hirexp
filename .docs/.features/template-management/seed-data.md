      "explanation": "Challenges agent's preparedness"
    }

### Rubric Configuration

*Same as Template 2 (Daniel), but with higher passing score due to difficulty*

```json
{
  "method": "weighted_average",
  "criteria": [
    {
      "name": "Empathy",
      "description": "Did agent show exceptional understanding and sincere apology?",
      "weight": 30,
      "scale": {"type": "numeric", "min": 1, "max": 5}
    },

## Templates 4 & 5: Inquiry Scenarios

**Templates:**
- `tmpl_miguel`: Inquiry - Easy (Miguel Santos)
- `tmpl_angela`: Inquiry - Hard (Angela Dela Cruz)

*Structure follows same pattern as Billing templates above, using data from `.docs/.template-scenario/Mock Call Simulation Promp.md` Inquiry sections*

## Seed Script Implementation

### TypeScript Seed File

```typescript
// prisma/seeds/ai-templates.ts

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { templates } from './data/templates';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export async function seedAiTemplates() {
  console.log('🌱 Seeding AI Templates...');

  // Create admin user if doesn't exist (for createdBy)
  const adminUser = await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { email: 'admin@hirexp.com' },
    update: {},
    create: {
      email: 'admin@hirexp.com',
      name: 'System Admin',
      role: 'ADMIN',
      status: 'ACTIVE',
    },
  });

  // Seed all templates
  for (const template of templates) {
    await prisma.aiTemplate.upsert({
      where: { id: template.id },
      update: template.data,
      create: {
        ...template.data,
        createdById: adminUser.id,
      },
    });

    console.log(`✅ Template seeded: ${template.data.name}`);
  }

  console.log('✨ AI Templates seeded successfully!');
}

// Run seed if executed directly
if (require.main === module) {
  seedAiTemplates()
    .catch((e) => {
      console.error('❌ Error seeding templates:', e);
      process.exit(1);
    })
    .finally(async () => {
      await prisma.$disconnect();
    });
}
```

### Template Data File

```typescript
// prisma/seeds/data/templates.ts

export const templates = [
  {
    id: 'tmpl_alex',
    data: {
      /* Full Alex template data from above */
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'tmpl_daniel',
    data: {
      /* Full Daniel template data from above */
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'tmpl_karen',
    data: {
      /* Full Karen template data from above */
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'tmpl_miguel',
    data: {
      /* Full Miguel template data */
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'tmpl_angela',
    data: {
      /* Full Angela template data */
    }
  }
];
```

### Running the Seed

```bash
# Add to package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed:templates": "ts-node prisma/seeds/ai-templates.ts"
  }
}

# Run seed
npm run db:seed:templates
```
